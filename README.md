# Ristretto Theme

Ristretto is a [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) theme based on [Macchiato Theme](https://github.com/biosan/jsonresume-theme-macchiato).

## Features

Ristretto has basic information hiding capabilities; if you want to produce a version of your resume without your physical address (e.g. for a public website), you can add `"private": true` in the `location` object of your resume. Currently, this only works for items in `basics`. To do the same for work experience, you may consider [HackMyResume](https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume). 

## Usage

You can use this theme with [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) or [KissMyResume](https://github.com/karlitos/KissMyResume), both powerful tools to build and analyze your JSON Resume.
